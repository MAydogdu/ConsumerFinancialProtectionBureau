         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",

I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",

At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.",

It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \n\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \n\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.",

The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",

I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",

I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

Since then our payments are not posted in a timely manner or for the amount sent. \nfor example payment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX per the payment history received from Nationstar the payment was not posted until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount of XXXX. \npayment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX but was not posted to our account until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount XXXX When our loan was transferred to Nationstar from XXXX we only received a good by letter from XXXX but no welcome package from Nationstar. So had to contact them to make sure the payment amount was the same as XXXX. I was told it was the same so that is what we are sending but they are only posting XXXX Have to call every month to get a payment history as they will not allow use of the website. Try to get information several times as to why it takes so long to post the money and why it is less than we sent. sent them the exact same documents attached and all they will state is they have no record of sending me the history every month and they are posting the money for what we sent. Have been unable to resolve the issue with Nationstar as they are not willing to listen or review the documents I sent to them as proof of what they sent me. Have been calling them every month since XXXX XXXX to get a payment history but they deny sending it each month.",

We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \n\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \n\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.",

The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",

I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",

I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

Since then our payments are not posted in a timely manner or for the amount sent. \nfor example payment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX per the payment history received from Nationstar the payment was not posted until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount of XXXX. \npayment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX but was not posted to our account until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount XXXX When our loan was transferred to Nationstar from XXXX we only received a good by letter from XXXX but no welcome package from Nationstar. So had to contact them to make sure the payment amount was the same as XXXX. I was told it was the same so that is what we are sending but they are only posting XXXX Have to call every month to get a payment history as they will not allow use of the website. Try to get information several times as to why it takes so long to post the money and why it is less than we sent. sent them the exact same documents attached and all they will state is they have no record of sending me the history every month and they are posting the money for what we sent. Have been unable to resolve the issue with Nationstar as they are not willing to listen or review the documents I sent to them as proof of what they sent me. Have been calling them every month since XXXX XXXX to get a payment history but they deny sending it each month.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.",

Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \n\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \n\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.",

The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",

I received a letter in the mail, stating that Experian received my correspondence and found it to be \" suspicious '' and that \" I did n't write it ''. Experian 's letter is worded to imply that I am incapable of writing my own letter. I was deeply offended by this implication. \nI called Experian to figure out why my letter was so suspicious. I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",

After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document. Hence, want to get back the deposit of {$350.00}.",

At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.",

It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.",

Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \n\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \n\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",

I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",

I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

So had to contact them to make sure the payment amount was the same as XXXX. I was told it was the same so that is what we are sending but they are only posting XXXX Have to call every month to get a payment history as they will not allow use of the website. Try to get information several times as to why it takes so long to post the money and why it is less than we sent. sent them the exact same documents attached and all they will state is they have no record of sending me the history every month and they are posting the money for what we sent. Have been unable to resolve the issue with Nationstar as they are not willing to listen or review the documents I sent to them as proof of what they sent me. Have been calling them every month since XXXX XXXX to get a payment history but they deny sending it each month.",

We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.",

Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \n\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \n\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.",

The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",

I received a letter in the mail, stating that Experian received my correspondence and found it to be \" suspicious '' and that \" I did n't write it ''. Experian 's letter is worded to imply that I am incapable of writing my own letter. I was deeply offended by this implication. \nI called Experian to figure out why my letter was so suspicious. I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "Started the refinance of home mortgage process with cash out option on XX/XX/2016. Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document. Hence, want to get back the deposit of {$350.00}.",

At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.",

My available credit was reduced from $ XXXX to XXXX ( the rough amount of my available balance ). \n\nWhen I called to question the change, I was provided a nob-descript response referencing my XXXX report. It was my understanding that under the FCRA I was entitled to a copy of this report, but was refused by Citi and have been given no further explanation. \n\nThis is predatory in that it affects my utilization of credit, further subjecting me to increase in APrs, etc and a higher cost of credit without any reason.",

It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \n\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \n\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \n\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \n\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \n\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \n\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \n\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.",

On paying the loan off on the XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX I was charged {$1000.00} interest fee. I spoke to US Bank in regards to this and was informed that they were unwilling to refund the charge of {$1000.00} even though the interest charged was the EXACT same day as the loan was paid off. I feel that a {$1000.00} charge for paying off a mortgage loan 2 days into the month is, for better words, a scam.",

Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \n\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \n\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "My Mortgage was transferred to Freedom Mortgage ( FM ) in XXXX 2016. Since that time I have repeatedly tried to have them correctly apply my regular Monthly payments, regular Monthly extra payments on principal only and random additional extra principal only payments. Note ; FM is responsible for auto drafting the Monthly payments from my account. My statements show the auto drafting Monthly. FM has wrongfully not applied payments on the correct days to correct places. I applied for a refinance to get rid of FM. ( I should not have to pay closing cost to get away from this lenders wrong doing. ) I was denied for the first time in my life because FM falsely and wrongfully reported me XXXX and 90 days late on payments. Please see the cut and past of my memo of the phone call to FM XXXX XXXX XXXX. \nXXXX XXXX 2016 Phone Call to FM XXXX XXXX teller # XXXX I requested to speak with a supervisor. XXXX pulled up my account. He ask what the call was about and said the calls are recorded. \nI told him this concerns the wrongful false reports FM made of late payments to the there Credit Bureaus. \nHe put me on a 17 min hold while connecting me to the Escalations Department. \nAfter a 17 min hold, I reached XXXX, teller # XXXX ext XXXX. \nI explained FM wrongfully reported false late payments to the credit bureaus. FM auto drafts payments and this information sent to the credit bureaus is false. Payments can not be late since FM is responsible for auto drafting the payments. \nI told FM, I was denied a refi loan because of FMs false wrongful reports to the credit bureaus. A second denial is pending from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well. \n\" XXXX said, looking into my account, I was not late on any house payments. '' I read the denial email to him from XXXX stating, \" Your loan is ineligible due to a 60 day late payment and a 90 day late payment reported on your credit report by Freedom Mortgage within the last 12 months. '' My XXXX was XXXX and now plummeted to XXXX, a serious matter. I have never been denied any credit until now. \nI ask FM to do an immediate bullseye correction today and immediately correct the false wrongful reports. I reminded him FM is responsible for auto drafting the house payments XXXX the first of each Month. And FM auto drafts an additional {$100.00} the first of each Month for the principal only. \nXXXX said he could get it corrected Monday. He said he will send it to Correspondence and Research and rush the response for a 48 hour 2 day turn around. \nI said this needs immediate attention, XXXX denial has already occurred and another application to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX will also occur if not corrected stat. \nI ask how was it that FM reported this false wrongful info to the credit bureaus, if as you just stated, I am not late? XXXX said my account does not show a XXXX or 90 day late report. XXXX said this requires research to find the answers. He said I would be emailed a response by Tues XXXX. Also I would receive a hard copy in the mail. XXXX said he would monitor the account to make sure it is being worked on. \nI requested a copy of the corrections be sent to me in email I gave him my phone numbers for verification and a call back. \nFreedom Mortgage has refused to properly apply my payments. FM has reported me XXXX and 90 days late to the credit bureaus ruining my XXXX XXXX. I am convinced FM will start proceeding for forclosure on my home.",

By XX/XX/XXXX, I was unable to pay my bills even though I was working full time, and I was forced to take a loan out. At that point, the loan seemed to disappear. There were a few transactions that were n't mine, but not enough to equal to what was missing. I printed out my bank statements and realized that what I purchased was {$5100.00} less than what came out of the account. That was in XX/XX/XXXX. It seems like every time I buy something, double that amount comes out of the account. \nI have called Bank of America repeatedly and they wo n't do anything about it. \nI have lost my house, was forced to move away from my family, and have defaulted on all my bills due to this problem. I have serious health issues that are going untreated at this time. \nSomeone I knew told me that they heard that people were stealing money out of the account in XXXX XXXX, and Bank of America has a picture of a person attempting to make a withdrawal out of my account for {$800.00} XX/XX/2015. I know this because they called and asked me to approve the transaction, and I told Bank of America it was n't me. This happened where I lived, in XXXX, CA. \nBank of America told me I did n't have to do anything and they would take care of it. I continued to have theft on my account and when I finally asked them about what there investigation had turned up, they would not give me a photo of the person. They told me they were not allowed to and I should have made a police report at the time if I wanted the photo. But I was not told to make a police report to get the photo of the person at the time of the incident. They told me I would have a name as soon as they did. \nDue to Bank of America 's actions, my life is ruined. My credit is in shambles and my health is deteriorating. I have tried to make police reports but due to Bank of America 's actions, the police say I have nothing to report. Everything was take from me and Bank of America is complacent in it.",

         "Consumer complaint narrative": "I have had an account with Transworld systems inc for years now to pay off my XXXX school loan and since the beginning have had nothing but a terrible experience. First of all, I 'm a XXXX, I do not make an hourly and when my account was open at XXXX years old - I did n't hAve the means to pay a XXXX $ debt over night. You 'd think they 'd have some compassion for a child, on her own working to take care of herself. No. From the beginning people were incorrectly charging me ( double charged me twice in a row ) and although they fixed it when I caught the double charges they never truly stayed on top of my account as they promised they would. Since then, we 've had tons of issues all due to miscommunication with the company. The number I 'd call to for schedualing my year round payments ( from there mailing letters ) was wrong and took me to a company who stated, \" this happens a lot I 'm not sure why they have n't released a new number but we 'll email them to let them know you 've tried to get in contact. '' That company emailed them a total of three times for me. It took me months to Figure out how to get in contact with them to renew my year of payments ( since the pryer year was up and you can only book a years worth of payments at a time ) and when I finally did they said I accumulated more interest from the months of me not paying ( when they were literally no where to be found it took the old company emailing them and hunting them down to get a number for me to call ). So I bit the bullet, higher the amount I was paying a month to show initiative and kept making my payments on time as usual. For months now I 've been trying to pay my account in full to close the account at an attempt to settle. When I first tried I only owed about 2800 $ but they insisted I pay double that in interest plus my tuition left from the school loan. Of course I could n't afford that, so i paid my monthly amount instead. The second time I called because I notice my balance was getting higher not lower, they said it 's the interest and said if I paid in full they could waive it, at the time I was switching job and was n't able to pay the XXXX $ they said I 'd have to, so again I just made my monthly payment. All the while I was working with the same man, XXXX XXXX, with these settlements. So, using the number I had been calling for months, I tried again to see if my balance had lowered so I could pay in full and close the account. Teds number was n't working. That to me was very shady since I had already spoke to a lawyer who told me it was ridiculous they were n't trying to make a settlement with me since their job is to close the account and was I sure this was a legit debt collecter. I immediately called again and spoke to two reps and a \" supervisor '' who just so happen \" did n't have the authority to make any calls on accounts '', which I 'm sure was actually just a receptionist because obviously supervisors have authority to do such things. He sent me to about three different voicemails, all of which I left messages on. As a matter of fact, I 've probably left about XXXX messages in total this week alone all through out the company trying to speak with someone who would authorize me paying my now balance of XXXX. The \" supervisor '' said I 'd have to pay XXXX , how could that be? What is my insterest at 40 %? How 's my interest more than the amount I owe? And how is the number larger than it was before now after I 've paid more into the loan? That 's when it hit me, they WANT me to stay on payment plans so that the interest accumulates and I 'm forced to continuing paying monthly for years which they make money on. I 'm so beyond tried with working with this shady, incompetent staff, tossing me from person to person, lying, not knowing anything about my account and taking advantage of a young girl trying to pay of her debt!",
